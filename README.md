# CSS collection
This repository serves as a collection of tricky CSS solutions, designed to document and share various techniques.

Each CSS solution is organized into individual components, with each component encapsulating a specific CSS trick. Although the application is developed using Vue.js, all solutions are implemented using vanilla CSS. However, in some cases, a small amount of JavaScript is necessary to resolve certain issues (e.g., displaying a password in a login form). The JavaScript is also included within the respective components.

You are welcome to explore and use any solutions that you find useful!

Every commit triggers a Github action which deploys the latest code to a Github page https://redakker.github.io/css/
